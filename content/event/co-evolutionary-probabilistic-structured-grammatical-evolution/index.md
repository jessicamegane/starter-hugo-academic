title: Co-evolutionary Probabilistic Structured Grammatical Evolution
abstract: Presentation of Co-evolutionary Probabilistic Structured Grammatical
  Evolution (Co-PSGE) algorithm, in which each individual in the population is
  composed by a grammar and a genotype, which is a list of dynamic lists, each
  corresponding to a non-terminal of the grammar containing real numbers that
  correspond to the probability of choosing a derivation rule. Each individual
  uses its own grammar to map the genotype into a program. During the
  evolutionary process, both the grammar and the genotype are subject to
  variation operators.
