abstract: Grammatical Evolution (GE) is one of the most popular Genetic
  Programming (GP) variants, and it has been used with success in several
  problem domains. Since the original proposal, many enhancements have been
  proposed to GE in order to address some of its main issues and improve its
  performance. In this paper we propose Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution
  (PGE), which introduces a new genotypic representation and new mapping
  mechanism for GE. Specifically, we resort to a Probabilistic Context-Free
  Grammar (PCFG) where its probabilities are adapted during the evolutionary
  process, taking into account the productions chosen to construct the fittest
  individual. The genotype is a list of real values, where each value represents
  the likelihood of selecting a derivation rule. We evaluate the performance of
  PGE in two regression problems and compare it with GE and Structured
  Grammatical Evolution (SGE). The results show that PGE has a better
  performance than GE, with statistically significant differences, and achieved
  similar performance when comparing with SGE.
