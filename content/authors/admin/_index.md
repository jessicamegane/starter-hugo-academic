I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, and I work as a researcher for the Evolutionary and Complex Systems (ECOS) group of the [Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra (CISUC)](https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/).

I am the author of Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution and some variants, and it will continue to be the main focus of my research.
I like to hear other researchers' opinions and discuss ideas, so feel free to get in touch!

Outside of academia, in my spare time I like to watch series, read mostly fiction books and play tennis.
